  |   A short while after the events of "Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari"...   |
  |   Reiho High School, where the battle took place, has these Big Four,   |
  |   who are feared by all the others schools around. And at the top of    |
  |   the Big Four, reigns only one man: Masao Kobayashi. Here's one of     |
  |   his stories.                                                          |

  |   Back in middle school, a mysterious event led him to meet a boy       |
  |   named Mizoguchi, who was actually a Time Regulator, going after an    |
  |   evil organization that has disrupted the time-space equilibrium.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   After finding out that Kobayashi has a hint of mysterious power in    |
  |   him, Mizoguchi has them set out together to take this evil            |
  |   organization down.                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   So, when Kobayashi's friend gets abducted by the evil organization,   |
  |   He puts on a calm face while burning with rage inside. He has got     |
  |   to go rescue his friend and bring an end to this evil organization.   |
  |                                                                         |
